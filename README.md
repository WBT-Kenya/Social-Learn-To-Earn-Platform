# Social Learn To Earn Platform

## Project Summary

- The social platform is the first inclusive Web3 social media mentorship, education and earning platform that empowers underprivileged girls and women in Africa through the use of blockchain and Web3 technologies.

## Problem Statement

- Currently, young girls between ages 14 and 24 are most affected by lack of access to quality education. This makes them vulnerable to misinformation and disinformation in social media platforms. This is a major challenge to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.

## Solution

- This is where we come in by building a social media platform that connects these young girls to mentors and role models who can help them make informed decisions about their lives and careers. This platform will also help them to learn new skills and earn tokens as an incentive for going through the learning process.
- The project is built on Hedera Hashgraph, a public distributed ledger that enables anyone to transact, play, and socialize in a secure, trusted, and fair manner.
